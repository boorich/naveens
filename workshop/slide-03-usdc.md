What is USDC?

## A digital dollar.

- **1 USDC = 1 USD** (always)
- Lives on your phone
- Send to anyone, instantly
- No bank needed

---

### Important: This is NOT Bitcoin or speculative crypto

**USDC is a "stablecoin"** and it's designed to stay at $1.00 USD, always.

Think of it like:
- A digital version of cash dollars
- But you can send it instantly, anywhere
- No bank account required
- No currency conversion fees

### Why it matters here:

Remember 2022? LKR collapsed. Savings gone.

**USDC doesn't collapse. It's pegged to USD.**

This is about **payment rails**, not trading. You're not buying USDC to sell it later. You are using it to pay for things, just like cash.

### How it works:

1. You receive USDC (like receiving cash)
2. You spend USDC (like spending cash)
3. It stays at $1.00 (unlike LKR, which can change)

**No speculation. No risk of losing value. Just a stable way to pay.**

### But how do we ensure these payments are transparent and can't be faked? That's where the ledger comes in.
