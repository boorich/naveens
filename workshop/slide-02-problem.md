The Problem We're Solving

## When prices are hidden:

- Tourists or nomads get overcharged (this backlashes)
- Locals get bargained down (that's the backlash)
- Everyone plays games (which is an economically wasteful and risky path)
- Nobody trusts anyone (only benefitting the largest extractors of value like Saas giants)

## What if the price was visible before the conversation starts?

### The real cost:

**Time wasted negotiating**  
**Trust broken**  
**Both sides feel cheated**

### The solution:

**Show the price upfront. No surprises. No games.**

This isn't about technology for technology's sake. It is about **fairness and trust** in everyday transactions.

### So how do we enable transparent pricing? We need a stable digital currency that works like cash but can be sent instantly.
