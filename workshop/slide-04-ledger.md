What is a Ledger?

## A place where every transaction is recorded. Publicly.

- No hidden fees
- No "he said, she said"
- Anyone can verify

---

### Think of it as:

**A receipt book that nobody can edit or hide.**

**In our case: The Ethereum blockchain.**

---

### Why this matters:

**Traditional payments:**  
- Bank records are private
- You can't verify what happened
- Disputes are "he said, she said" by nature

**Ledger-based payments:**  
- Every transaction is visible
- You can check your own payments
- No one can change the record
- It's like a public receipt book

### Privacy note:

The ledger shows **amounts and addresses**, not your name or personal information. It's like a public receipt book where entries are numbered, not named.

### For developers: Ethereum blockchain specifics

**We're using the Ethereum blockchain** (specifically Base, an Ethereum L2).

**What this means technically:**

- **Ethereum blockchain:** A distributed ledger maintained by thousands of nodes
- **Immutable:** Once recorded, transactions cannot be changed or deleted
- **Public:** All transactions are visible to anyone (via block explorers)
- **Cryptographically secured:** Uses cryptographic proofs to ensure integrity
- **Decentralized:** No single entity controls it

**Key concepts:**

- **Blocks:** Batches of transactions (recorded every ~2 seconds on Base)
- **Transactions:** Individual payment/action records
- **Addresses:** Public identifiers (like account numbers, but pseudonymous)
- **Smart contracts:** Code that executes automatically (like USDC contract)

**How to verify transactions:**

- **Base block explorer:** https://basescan.org
- **Ethereum block explorer:** https://etherscan.io
- Enter any address or transaction hash to see full history
- All data is public and verifiable

**Why Ethereum (and Base):**

- **Mature infrastructure:** Well-tested, secure, widely used
- **Developer tools:** Extensive libraries, documentation, tooling
- **Interoperability:** Works with standard tools (MetaMask, wallets, etc.)
- **Cost-effective:** Base L2 reduces transaction costs significantly

**This is infrastructure, not speculation.** The blockchain is the payment rail, just like the internet is the communication rail.

### Now we have stable money and a transparent ledger. How do we put them together to create fair, transparent payments? That's x402.
